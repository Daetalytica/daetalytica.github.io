**Code of Conduct**

1. **THE ETHIC OF CRYPTO-RECIPROCITY**
   - Protect others' digital rights and privacy as you would protect your own. Engage with respect and mindfulness, considering how your actions may resonate within the community. Encourage cryptographic practices that empower and protect individuals.

2. **DEEDS OVER CREEDS**
   - We don't prejudge based on superficial traits. Actions and accomplishments define you in this community. Harassment and discrimination will not be tolerated. Your success or failure depends on your competence and contributions.

3. **CELEBRATE DIVERSITY**
   - Our differences in abilities, passions, and perspectives are our strength. We recognize and celebrate our individual uniqueness, embracing that our diverse backgrounds foster creativity and innovation.

4. **RADICAL ACCEPTANCE**
   - Acceptance is our mantra, not mere tolerance. We strive to understand and embrace various perspectives, focusing on positive attributes rather than dwelling on differences. Direct energy towards growth and connection, rather than friction and frustration.

5. **THINK BEFORE YOU JUDGE**
   - Judging and condemning others reveals more about our own inadequacies than those of others. Reflect, question, and strive for understanding before passing judgment.

6. **REJECT VICTIMHOOD AND MARTYRDOM**
   - The community has no place for habitual victims or self-martyrs. If you champion a cause, do so with sincerity and integrity, not seeking personal attention or sympathy.

7. **SELF-AWARENESS AND COMMUNITY VALUE**
   - Recognize your worth and what you bring to the community. The value you believe you hold must align with what you actively contribute. Self-reflection and humility pave the way for growth and understanding.

8. **FIERCE, FAIR COMPETITION**
   - Encourage healthy competition that drives innovation, growth, and resilience. Engage with integrity, respecting the rules, and honoring the spirit of the challenge.
