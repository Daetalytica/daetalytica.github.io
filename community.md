# Community

## A Special Note to Early Members
We're excited to welcome you to the DÃ¦talytica community! As we are in the early stages of building this digital haven, you might notice that our community platforms are still growing.

Please don't be discouraged by the current size; your presence is a valuable and integral part of what we're creating. Your insights, curiosity, and passion for privacy will help shape and build a vibrant community.

Feel free to take the initiative, engage, share, and even suggest new platforms like Discord, Matrix, or others if you'd rather be there. Together, we'll forge connections, learn, and create a safe space for all digital citizens.
